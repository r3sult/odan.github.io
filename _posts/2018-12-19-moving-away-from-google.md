I would say that I was a very loyal and excessive Google user. 

But lately I became more and more frustrated with the usability of Gmail, Calendar and Notes. 

Therefore I decided to search for alternatives. 

After a lot of consideration I decided to switch to the following alternatives:

* Gmail -> [Outlook.com](https://outlook.com)
* Calendar -> [Calendar Outlook.com](https://office.live.com/start/Calendar.aspx)
* Notes and Todos -> Outlook.com OneNote (very cool)
* Google Drive -> OneDrive (15 GB free)
* Search -> Google, but DuckDuckGo is a free alternative
* Google Plus -> Twitter
* Blog -> Github pages
* YouTube -> No change
* Mobile (Android) -> No change
* Google Maps -> No change, alternatives: [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps)
* Chrome browser -> No change, alternative: [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)

## Make a Backup!

* Use [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to backup your emails and most of the files stored in your google account.
* **Warning*: Your [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/
) will **not be included in the backup**! Just export the Slides to PowerPoint.

## Moving Gmail to Outlook.com

I moved all my Gmail emails with Outlook for Windows by moving all directories via IMAP to the new Outlook mailbox. 

By defalt IMAP is diabled in Gmail. To enable IMAP you have to [enable the IMAP access for external applications](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en).

## Moving the Google to the Outlook.com Calendar

I just created my calendar events manually.

But you could of course [export your Google calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111?hl=en) 
into vCalendar (*.ics) files and [import the them into your outlook calendar](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-outlook-com-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c).

## Moving Google Drive to OneDrive

* Install the OneDrive client and just move all the files out of the Google Drive directory.
* Don't forget to clean the recycle bin. You can permanently [delete all Google Drive files](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375102?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) or empty your entire trash.

## Moving Notes to OneNote

* I exported my [Google notes](https://keep.google.com/) manually into Google Docs and copy/pasted the content from the 
Google Doc to OneNote.
