Dear hipster, coolster, frontend, whatever developer. 

I just want to say that I hate your fucking, ugly, useless, crappy, shiny SPA. It's such fucking crap to use your SPA website 
and web application that I have to puke on my screen and keyboard. I hate the fucking usability that you gave me. 
I hate the fucking memory usage, the loading times and the fucking browser memory leaks you cause with your fucking 
SPA JS framework of the week. My SSD, my CPU and 16 GB+ memory are crying over your sucking use of resources.

I hate you because you don't care about the limited resources of our planet. 

I hate you because you loaded megabytes of crappy JS code onto my computer and you don't care about my limited time. 

You shit on the whole rest of the world just to make you think that YOU and only YOU are the coolest person in the world. 

You are and idiot, you are an egoist and therefore you are not a good developer. 

You just don't understand that the web is document-oriented. You are the plague of the digital economy. 

Please go home and think about my words or go and change your profession. 

Once again. Please stop writing fucking SPAs, you fucking idiot.
