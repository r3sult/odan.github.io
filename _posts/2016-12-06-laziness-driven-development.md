* Make smart decisions today to save yourself time and headache tomorrow.
* Don't waste time. Plan your (working) week.
* Be smart. Think twice before writing lines of code.
* Every line of code must be maintained.
* Write readable, reusable, state of the art and minimalistic code.
* Try to optimize (refactor) before closing the project/ticket.
* Test first. Because later nobody writes tests.
* Write meaningful DocBlocks before committing to version control. (Because nobody can remember about it later.)
* Teach people, practice pair programming (XP) and code reviews. (Because you need a private life and vacation without emails and phone calls.)
* Write documentation (Wiki) directly after completing the project/ticket.
* Avoid problems. Talk to people before troubles will occur.
* Stay healthy. Drink at least 2 liters of water (or coffee *gg) per day.
