In object-oriented programming (like Java, C#), a method is a subroutine (or procedure or function) associated with a class. 
Both are same, there is no difference its just a different term for the same thing.

In Visual Basic a method "Function" returns a value, a Method (Sub) doesn't.

But in PHP we have mix of object-oriented and procedural programming. 
In this case, we have to distinguish between an a function and a method.

**Function** 

* If the function is built-in (internal) or a user-defined function. 
* If the function is not defined in a class.

**Method**

* If the method is defined in a class.
